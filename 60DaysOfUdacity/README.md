# 60 Days of Udacity Challenge
 I would be logging daily updates of my progess during the [Bertelsmann #60DaysofUdacity](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/bertelsmann-challenge/community/60-days-of-udacity) coding challenge. The goal of the challenge is to help me set *Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound (SMART)* goals for the next two months. The two elements for success in this challenge are *consistency* and *commitment*. I'm excited taking up this challenge!
