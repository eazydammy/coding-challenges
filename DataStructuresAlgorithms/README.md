# Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge
 I would be logging daily updates of my progess during the DSA learning challenge. The goal of the challenge is to help me set *Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound (SMART)* goals for the next two months. The two elements for success in this challenge are *consistency* and *commitment*. I'm excited taking up this challenge!

I would learning by using the following methods:

1. Text: Each day, I would complete at least 10 pages in the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H Goldwasser](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275).
2. Lecture: I will audit the [CS 401 Computer Algorithms course](https://sidiropo.people.uic.edu/courses/2020_spring_401/) in my school this term. The official text for this course is [Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kleinberg-Algorithm-Design/PGM319216.html).
3. YouTube: I will follow through the lectures and revision videos in the popular [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb).
4. Practice: I would do my best to solve as many competitive programming problems I can find to practice the DSA concepts I'll be learning in this challenge. I would majorly practice on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
